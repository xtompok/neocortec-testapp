# neocortec-testapp
Some demo apps for Neocortec wireless modules


## Connection
Demoboard has two serial ports connected to FTDI USB-RS232 bridge. In my Linux, an application serial port is the first, e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0 and the system serial port is the second, e.g. /dev/ttyUSB1.

## About code
Code is ugly, its only purpose is test communication and range of neocortec modules.
